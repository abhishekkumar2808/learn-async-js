Explain the code execution based on the order of the messages logged in src/quiz/promise-2darray.txt.

- Console log of sumPromise1 is printed first followed by console log of sumPromise2 before the result of sumPromise1 is printed in the output becasue the computation takes time.
- Hence, the computation is done in async manner.
- So, output of the sumPromise1 is printed first and then followed by the output of sumPromise2.
